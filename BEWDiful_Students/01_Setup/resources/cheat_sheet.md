##Command Line Basics & Git

The terminal (command prompt on Windows) is the developer way of navigating your computer. You are probably used to using the graphical interface provided (Finder on a mac and MyComputer on Windows).

Here is a quick reference for some of the most common commands you will use in this class. 
Remember when you see ```“$”``` or ```“C:\>”``` in these notes that is the prompt, don’t type it.

 		$  MAC
		C:\>  WINDOWS

####Navigation


How do I get into a folder?

  		$cd folder_name
		C:\> cd folder_name

Use quotation marks if your folder name has spaces.

How do I get to the parent folder?

		$cd ..
		C:\> cd ..

How do I see what is in the folder?

		$ls
		C:\> dir


How do I know what folder I am in?

		$pwd
		C:\> cd

How do I create a new folder?

		$mkdir folder_name
		C:\> mkdir folder_name

####Deleting - (Proceed With Caution)

How do I delete a folder?

		$rm -r folder_name
		c:\> rmdir folder-name

How do I delete a file?
		
		$rm -f file_name
		C:\> del file_name

How do I move a file?

		$mv file_name folder_name
		C:\> move file_name folder_name
The file is removed from the old location and moved to the new one.

You can rename a file the same way

		$mv old_name new_name
		C:\> move old_name new_names
